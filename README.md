# PowerShell Reports

In this repository I collect PowerShell Snippets for reporting purposes, because everybody loves their Excel files ;). Those reports include all possible technologies and are not limit to one product.

The purpose is to make it easier for everybody to create reports in their daily business and not have to reinvent the wheel. Feel free to contribute if you also have a great report in your script snippets.

## The only rule of this repository

Reports do not change anything but the output of the report!
